If you are looking to create a single-page website and find Carrd a little expensive or lacking in features, this article will help you find a great alternative to the platform. Although there are many articles online about the Carrd alternatives, most of them list the [#website\_builders](https://www.utilitytools.online/blog/hashtags/website_builders) that are expensive than Carrd or are an overkill for what you need for your website.

  

I have compiled the list of the best Carrd alternatives that are best for creating a single-page website. The list also includes a website builder that is absolutely free and allows its users to add their own domain without any limitations. If you want to know about it keep reading the article. The main focus while compiling this list was on ease of use, pricing, features, and effectiveness in building the one-page websites for your business, portfolio, or personal website.

  

## About the Carrd Website Builder

Carrd([Official Website](https://carrd.co/)) is a one-page website builder with an easy-to-use to use website builder, a large collection of pre-made templates([check out Carrd Templates](https://carrd.co/build)), responsive websites, and basic features of a website builder. The platform is good for building websites for a personal CV, a product, or service landing page, a single form, a portfolio, or any other one-page website.

  

While the website builder in itself is not that bad, you can not add your personal domain to a free site, and the templates are limited. Furthermore, to unlock all website builder features, you need to get a pro plan of Carrd, which, by the way, is cheaper compared to many website builders([You can check the pricing plans of Carrd Here](https://carrd.co/pro)). But still, the platform itself lacks a lot of features compared to other modern website builders.

  

## Best Carrd Alternatives

Let us come to the main point of this article, the best alternatives for Carrd. I will not share the top website builders you can use to build a beautiful single-page website in seconds.

  

### 1\. Onepage(Best Overall Carrd Alternative)

  

The first platform in our list is the Onepage. This platform is best for building landing pages, funnels, Linktree, internal pages, quizzes, single booking services or products, portfolios, CVs, and many more types of websites.

![Onepage website editor - Best overall Carrd alternative](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8874a0_62b5eb1173a24b649da189615668552a~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_925,h_435,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/8874a0_62b5eb1173a24b649da189615668552a~mv2.png)

**Onepage website editor**

  

Out of all the website builders listed in this article, Onepage has the best pre-built templates for websites. Its templates are one of the best in the business with beautiful colors, fonts, and modern layouts.

  

#### Onepage VS Carrd

  

The Onepage is one of the most impressive website builders I have seen. The overall platform is well optimized and has everything a brand needs and nothing that a brand does not need. It is neither lacking nor an overkill, a perfect balance website builder.

  

The only place where Onepage is behind the Carrd is the pricing. In every other aspect, it is better compared to the Carrd. I especially love the SEO in this platform. **The way Onepage handles website SEO is second to none. You can find all images in one place to set Alt text, you can add advanced SEO schema in the head code, and it has integrated AI SEO as well.**

### 3\. Versoly(Best for people who need website+Blog)

The Versoly is a balanced platform that has good pricing for what it offers. The platform has some very nice templates and different tiers in pricing that give different features. This platform is good for those people who need a blog along with a one-page website for their brand.

![Versoli website editor](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8874a0_8ef739e005d4481b8c4c5a4ecd43308e~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_925,h_438,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/8874a0_8ef739e005d4481b8c4c5a4ecd43308e~mv2.png)

**Versoli website editor**

  

**Among all the website builders and Carrd alternatives, Versoly websites have the best performance, which search engines love.** This makes Versoli the best Carrd alternative in terms of user experience and SEO.

  

If I talk about specific cases, **you can use it for service-based brands, like dog grooming or Cleaning services.** While the main page of the Versoli website will act as a static page, the blog can help you attract more clients and rank your website on search engines. **Versoly also has its own CMS(Content Management System)** that can help you build dynamic pages, a great way to expand your website's reach and content diversity.

  

Furthermore, **unlike most websites that only increase the limits of services in their pricing plan tiers, Versoly actually adds good features that a brand actually needs.** If you are starting your business from scratch, you will find its scalability very tempting.

### 3\. Kit(Best For Creators that need E-mail Marketing)

Kit, formally known as ConvertKit, is a very popular platform among creators. Kit is an Email marketing first platform. It is best for those brands and creators who need Email outreach as a prime function. For example, YouTube creators or the Community who want to send email notifications about a new video or updates can use this platform.

  

![Kit Landing Page Editor](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8874a0_1b797f82269a45a395f043893294851f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_925,h_443,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/8874a0_1b797f82269a45a395f043893294851f~mv2.png)

**Kit Landing Page Editor**

  

If you are a creator or a small business owner who is starting from nothing, Kit can be the best choice to expand your business and profits.

  

In the free plan of the Kit, you get 10,000 subscribers, Email campaigns, a free website landing page, E-commerce, subscription sales, and monetization tools. These features alone make Kit worth it. **Furthermore, the best part is that you can add your own custom brand domain even in the free plan.** You can expand the website and landing page when your profits increase over time. Kit also lets you create unlimited landing pages, making it an ideal choice for PPC campaigns and for promoting new products, services, or online courses.

### 4\. ClickFunnels(Best For funnels and Online Courses)

**ClickFunnels is the best alternative for Carrd if you are a coach, sell online courses, or specifically need funnels to sell your products, services, or collect leads.** It is also an ideal choice for those who want to manage multiple brand websites at a time to maximize profits. If you want to try dropshipping using Zendrop, ClickFunnel can also provide an efficient workflow in that case.

  

ClickFunnel is an all-in-one platform to manage all your funnels, e-mail marketing, sales, and online courses.

ClickFunnel is on the expense side of platforms. However, if you can use it well, recovering that fees is a matter of days. The workflow, email marketing, and automation tools make ClickFunnel a platform worth trying.

### 5\. Solo by Mozilla(Free Carrd Alternative)

**Solo is an absolutely free AI website builder and the only free alternative to the Carrd.** **Solo is the only website builder with no pricing plans at all.** That is right, you do not have to pay a cent to create a website using Solo.

![Solo website designer - A free alternative to Carrd](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8874a0_336405e4060b4a59854102fac5e9865a~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_925,h_439,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/8874a0_336405e4060b4a59854102fac5e9865a~mv2.png)

### 6\. Instapage

The next platform in our list is Instapage. **This platform is best for those people who have a clear goal in mind for creating a one-page website, for example, a PPC campaign, lead generation, social media ads, specific audience targeting, etc.** Instapage has a specific solution for every category.

  

**I especially like the dedicated landing pages for Google and social ads(Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc).** Many people who frequently run ad campaigns for their products or services will find this platform very helpful. The platform also has a large number of integration options.

  

The biggest problem with this platform, though, is its pricing. **Instapage has a monthly subscription price of $99/Month and $199/Month(Annual Plan has 20% Off), which is ridiculous!** Even after such a high price tag, there is a small limit on monthly visitors that doesn't make any sense. As such, the only people who should use it are those who run PPC campaigns and need a quick landing page setup for their ads.

### 7\. Linktree

**Linktree is a great alternative to Carrd for specific use cases that involve social media marketing(SMM).** If your business especially needs social marketing and social ads, Linktree can be a great Carrd alternative. You can sell your products and services using this platform as well.

Using this platform, you can deploy a website with products, link in bio, content highlights, etc, in seconds.
